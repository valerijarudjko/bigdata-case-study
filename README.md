# Big Data in the Textile Industry - Case Study

This project analyses a family-owned textile company transitioning from local operations to international markets through online sales and data-driven strategies. It focuses on applying Big Data techniques, and creating a dedicated social media monitoring team to better understand customer behavior and market trends. The case also examines differences between domestic and international sales models, highlighting the need for tailored approaches. Objectives include improving decision-making, enhancing customer experience, and increasing global competitiveness through technology and process innovation.

## The Textile Company: Background

Two brothers are taking over the family business because their parents, who have been running the textile company they founded 30 years ago, are retiring. The company began as a small workshop where they did everything from making patterns and sewing garments to selling them directly. Over time, they contacted distributors and started seeing their garments sold not only in various local shops but also in other cities. This growth led to the opening of additional stores in different cities, eventually creating a network of shops selling their garments.

Currently, the two brothers are running the company and have decided to develop a strategy using current technology to expand internationally and enter the online sales market. In addition to their usual team, they decided to hire a data analyst and apply Big Data techniques to the business.

Their international business model focuses on selling their products online through a website with a virtual catalog. In cities with populations over 50,000, they maintain at least one physical location that includes a storage area for products and provides in-person customer service for returns or exchanges, but not for direct sales.

The data analyst also recommended forming a team to monitor social media in different countries. The brothers explained that they already had two people responsible for creating content for their social media platforms, but the analyst insisted they also needed people to monitor social networks, separate from the content creators.

The brothers agreed, and a work team was set up for this purpose. There is a central office where all the engineers, analysts, clothing designers, and marketing staff work, and from where garments are shipped to different centers in each country.

In contrast to their international model, in England, they operate traditional physical stores where they sell their products, although they also offer online sales. In these stores, employees must fill out a form documenting the actions of each potential customer who enters, noting whether they are looking for a specific garment or just browsing, whether they make a purchase or not, the purchase amount, if they are accompanied, or if they mention any promotion seen on social media.

Additionally, when garments are sold, the scanned label information is automatically sent to the central office where the analysts work.

## To do:
1. Why is it important to add a data analyst to the company's team? If the company already has a marketing team that reports sales statistics, is it really necessary to hire this analyst? 

2.	The emphasis on forming a separate social media monitoring team stems from the importance of analyzing discussions on social networks about fashion trends and the types of garments people wear based on factors like age, social status, economic, and cultural conditions. While the content team manages responses to their social media posts, should content creation and monitoring be combined, or should they follow different strategies? Should the content team create posts based on the marketing department's direction and have the monitoring team follow the data analyst's guidelines? Justify your answer with an example. 

3.	How can the reporting of products sold in physical stores, which arrives via scanned labels, impact the apparel design team? 

4.	Should the sales and promotion strategy in England, which includes both online and physical sales, be the same as the international strategy, which is primarily online? Specify any strategic similarities or differences.

5.	Can the same information on the presence of potential customers in physical stores be gathered from customers who visit the service centers in foreign cities? 

6.	Foreign customers can visit the physical center to return or exchange garments. How can Big Data techniques help optimize this process and improve the response for both the customer and the company?
